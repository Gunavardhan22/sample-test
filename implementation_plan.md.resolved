# Landing Page Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Create a modern, responsive Landing Page for a Dashboard-style application. The design will focus on visual excellence, using a "Healthcare/Admin Dashboard" aesthetic as referenced by the user (clean lines, card-based layout, modern typography).

**Note:** Since the project requirements (PDF) could not be read, I will use **generic "SaaS Dashboard" content** with a focus on Healthcare/Admin analytics as a theme, which can be easily swapped out later.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Tech Stack Selection**: I am proceeding with **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS** as this is the standard for modern, performant web apps and matches the "Tailwind" reference provided.
> 
> **Content**: I will use placeholder text and generated images/mockups for the content since the specific domain requirements are currently unknown.

## Proposed Changes

### Project Setup
#### [NEW] [Project Structure]
- Initialize Vite project (`npm create vite@latest`)
- Configure Tailwind CSS (PostCSS, Autoprefixer, `tailwind.config.js`)
- Setup project folder structure (`src/components`, `src/assets`, `src/pages`)

### Frontend Components
#### [NEW] `src/components/Create`
- `Layout.tsx`: Main page layout wrapper
- `Navbar.tsx`: Responsive navigation bar
- `Hero.tsx`: High-impact hero section with a "Dashboard Preview" visual (Glassmorphism/Gradient style)
- `Features.tsx`: Grid layout showcasing key features (using icons/cards)
- `Footer.tsx`: Standard footer

### Styling
- **Theme**: "Modern Clinical" / "Clean Admin"
    - Colors: Slate/Zinc neutrals with a primary accent color (e.g., Teal or Blue for Healthcare/Trust).
    - Typography: Inter or Plus Jakarta Sans.
    - Effects: Soft shadows, rounded corners (xl), subtle borders.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `npm run dv` to verify build success.
- Check console for no errors.

### Manual Verification
- Visual check of responsiveness (Mobile vs Desktop).
- Verify "WOW" factor (animations, hover states).
